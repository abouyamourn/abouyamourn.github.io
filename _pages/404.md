I'm a methodologist in the Political Science Department at UC Berkeley, interested in causal inference, machine learning, selective inference, and game theory. I'm advised by Thad Dunning, Avi Feller, Peng Ding, and Erin Hartman. 

I'm English and Moroccan, and a lifelong chorister.

My CV is [here](files/Adam_Bouyamourn_Curriculum_Vitae-1.pdf).
