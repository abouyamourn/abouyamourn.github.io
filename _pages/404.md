I'm a methodologist in the Political Science department at UC Berkeley. 
My work is in causal inference, machine learning, and selective inference. 
I'm advised by Thad Dunning, and my dissertation committee members are Kirk Bansak, Erin Hartman, Avi Feller, and Peng Ding. 

I'm British and Moroccan, and a lifelong chorister. 

My CV is [here](files/Adam_Bouyamourn_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
