I'm a methodologist in the Political Science department at UC Berkeley. 
I'm interested in faithful LLMs; causal inference and selective inference; and the politics of machine learning and AI. 
I'm advised by Thad Dunning, Kirk Bansak, Erin Hartman, Avi Feller, and Peng Ding. 

I'm British and Moroccan, and a lifelong chorister. 

My CV is [here](files/Adam_Bouyamourn_Curriculum_Vitae-1.pdf).
