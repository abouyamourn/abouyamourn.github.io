Welcome! I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Politics, Statistics and Machine Learning at Princeton University, where I am working with Arthur Spirling. 

I'm a methodologist broadly interested in using optimization methods to design efficient experiments, and in understanding the social implications of AI tools. 

I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by Thad Dunning, with Kirk Bansak, Erin Hartman, Avi Feller, and Peng Ding on my dissertation committee. 

I'm British and Moroccan, and a lifelong chorister. 

My CV is [here](files/AB_CV.pdf).
