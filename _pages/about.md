I'm a methodologist in the Political Science department at UC Berkeley. 
I'm interested in causal inference, selective inference, and the politics of machine learning and AI. 
I'm advised by Thad Dunning, Avi Feller, Peng Ding, and Erin Hartman. 

I'm English and Moroccan, and a lifelong chorister.
